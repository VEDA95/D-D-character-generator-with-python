# D-D-character-generator-with-python
The end goal of this project is to create a functional program with python that can create random character sheets that can be used for d&amp;d campaigns. I'm using d&d 3.5e as my beginning point for this project, but I do plan on implementing other versions of D&amp;d later down the road

#Current Progress:
So far the I've created a ability score generator with the ability to auto reroll stats. The next two parts I plan to work on is a python dictionary containing all possible character races, and a name generator that'll generate names based on gender and race.
